# Simple Escrow Smart Contract

## Description of the Project

The Simple Escrow Smart Contract is a decentralized escrow system built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. This contract provides a trustless intermediary solution for peer-to-peer transactions, where funds are held securely until predetermined conditions are met.

The contract features two core functions:
- **Create Escrow**: Allows buyers to deposit funds into an escrow agreement with a specified seller
- **Release Funds**: Enables buyers to release the escrowed funds to the seller upon satisfaction of transaction terms

Built with security and simplicity in mind, this contract eliminates the need for traditional third-party escrow services while ensuring transaction safety through blockchain technology. The contract uses AptosCoin as the native currency and implements basic validation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized fund releases and double-spending.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to democratize secure transactions by providing a simple, transparent, and accessible escrow solution on the Aptos blockchain. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Trust Barriers**: Remove the need for buyers and sellers to trust each other directly by providing a secure, automated intermediary
- **Reduce Transaction Costs**: Minimize fees associated with traditional escrow services through blockchain automation
- **Enhance Global Accessibility**: Enable secure peer-to-peer transactions regardless of geographical boundaries or traditional banking limitations
- **Promote Financial Inclusion**: Provide escrow services to individuals and businesses who may not have access to conventional financial intermediaries

By leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology, we envision a future where anyone can engage in secure digital commerce with confidence, knowing their funds are protected until transaction completion.

## Future Scope of the Project
